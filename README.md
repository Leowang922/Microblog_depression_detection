#Detecting depression on Sina Microblog:A document classification method based on depressing domain lexicon

Abstract
Depression is a worldwide disease which poses great threat to personal health and is still underdiagnosed. Nowadays, more and more people express their opinions and feelings on social media platforms, generating a huge amount of user data. User Generated Content (UGC) is proved to be useful for recognizing people with mental illness. Thus, this study proposes a UGC based method to detect depression users on Sina Microblog. Firstly, the sampling method is leveraged to get the proportion of depressed users on Sina Microblog and constructed the dataset. Then, four feature groups are defined, which are related to user profile, social engagement, emotion and language concerning the depressing domain-lexicon. Finally, three classification models are constructed and the detecting performance is evaluated. The experimental results show that the best performing model yields an average F1-measure of 0.712. This study proves the ability of the domain-lexicon based model in identifying depressed users on social media.
